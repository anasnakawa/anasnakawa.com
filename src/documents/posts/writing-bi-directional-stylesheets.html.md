 
I have been working with di-directional web applications / websites for more than 3 years, and I would like to share my experiment
on this subject, since I have tried some several methodologies to solve this common problem.

### Myths

* just put `<html dir="rtl">` will solve all of your problems


usually in the past people used to write 2 separate stylesheets for their websites

### 1. two different stylesheets

### 2. scoped direction classes

### 3. auto-generated rtl stylesheet

### 4. preprocessors
