it has been a while since my last blog post, which happened over 2 years ago..  

usually i am not that active blogger, maybe because I wasn't feeling comfortable with the blog engines out there, also lets not forget that most of the times i am a lazy person, especially when it comes to writing posts.

### Why I hated blog engines ?

actually I think blog engines ( such as Wordpress, tumblr ..etc ) are great for writing posts for most people, but when it comes to a developer like me sometimes I just don't feel that I have the freedom that I want..

either if I want to share a code snippet with some fancy syntax highlighting, or if I want to provide some live demo, both ways I will end up looking for some plugin to satisfy my needs ... not exactly what I was looking for.

the answer should be much simpler, all I need is to write HTML/CSS & JS code at my convenience, and that was not much to ask.

### A better alternative..

Last year I started to hear about somthing called **static site generators**, I even started to see some great front-end developers shifting their blogs into one of these generators..

first I was surprised that most static site generator implementations out there were built on ruby ( e.g: [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll), [Octopress](https://github.com/imathis/octopress) ), but since I am a javascript guy, I was looking for something more familiar to me...a Node Js implementation, and found that [Docpad](https://github.com/bevry/docpad) was exactly what I was looking for.

getting started with docpad was straight forward, they have some nice set of [pre-built skeletons](http://docpad.org/docs/skeletons), so I cloned their [Bootstrap Skeleton](https://github.com/docpad/twitter-bootstrap.docpad), and got my hands on this nice technology..

### Design inspiration

it is worth mentioning that this site was not only inspired by [Orman's Clark](http://premiumpixels.com/) great designs, I actually transofmed his [Code Editor App](http://www.premiumpixels.com/freebies/code-editor-app-psd/) completly into what you see over here.

### Site code

you can find the source code of this site hosted on [Github](https://github.com/anasnakawa/anasnakawa.com), go a head make a fork, and have it at your own site, I will be more than happy :)
