<p>I have been working with di-directional web applications / websites for more than 3 years, and I would like to share my experiment
on this subject, since I have tried some several methodologies to solve this common problem.</p>
<h3 id="myths">Myths</h3>
<ul>
<li>just put <code>&lt;html dir=&quot;rtl&quot;&gt;</code> will solve all of your problems</li>
</ul>
<p>usually in the past people used to write 2 separate stylesheets for their websites</p>
<h3 id="1-two-different-stylesheets">1. two different stylesheets</h3>
<h3 id="2-scoped-direction-classes">2. scoped direction classes</h3>
<h3 id="3-auto-generated-rtl-stylesheet">3. auto-generated rtl stylesheet</h3>
